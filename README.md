[x] Create a new app that does the following.

Practice Creating Variables

    [x] Create a variable (use your best judgment for type) that stores the numberOfCupsOfCoffee that you drink every day.
    [x] Create a variable (use your best judgment for type) called fullName and set it equal to your full name.
    [x] Create a variable (use your best judgment for type) call today and set it equal to today's date.
    [x] Use Console.WriteLine and your variables, numberOfCupsOfCoffee, fullName, and today, to output all three on one line.

Practice Getting Input From the User

    [x] Ask the user for their name and store it in a variable named userName.
    [x] Print out a greeting to the user, using their name.

Practice Getting Different Types of Input From the User

    [x] Ask the user to input two numbers.
    [x] Get the numbers as strings using Console.ReadLine, store them in variables named firstNumberAsString and secondNumberAsString
    [x] Converting String Input Into Numbers
    [x] Convert each string above to a double using Double.parse. Save the first value in a variable named firstOperand and the second value in a variable named           secondOperand.

Doing Math

    [x] Add the operand variables from above and save the results in a variable named sum.
    [x] Subtract the secondOperand variable from the firstOperand variable and save the results in a variable named difference.
    [x] Multiply the operand variables and save the results in a variable named product.
    [x] Divide the firstOperand by the secondOperand and save the results in a variable named quotient.
    [x] Find the remainder when one operand is divided by the other and save the results in a variable named remainder. See this page if you need to learn more about the modulo operator.
    [x] Use Console.WriteLine to present the user, in a meaningful way, each of the values for the sum, difference, quotient, product, and remainder variables.      (e. g. perhaps one of your outputs is similar to If you add 4 and 5 you get 9 if 4 and 5 were the input)

[x] Adventure Mode

Using Logic

    [x] Add some logic to your program that prints a different, special, greeting to the user if their name happens to be Alice.

Using Advanced Types

    [x] Use the type DateTime to represent the data variables.

[x]Epic Mode

[x] Move all of your code to separate file and invoke it from the Main method.
